        <h2>Muay Thai - Thai Boxing</h2>

        <p>Besides coding, my other favorite thing to do and passion is fighting (yes, fighting ...but only in the ring ahah).</p>
        <p>I fell in love with the sport since the first time I step into the gym in 2016. I had my first competition in 2017 and since then I have been competing <br>
            actively and I got to become 2x Muay Thai champion.
            I train 5 days a week for about 2 to 3 hours, it's a sport that requires a lot dedication, focus and commitment.
        </p>
        <p>Thanks to this sport I have learned not only to defend myself but to be a lot more dedicated, to work hard to achive my goals,<br>
            and that every sacrifice has it reward at the end, not only in the ring but in every area of my life.
        </p>
        <p>Friday <strong>July 1st</strong> I will be fighting for another national belt in New York.</p>
