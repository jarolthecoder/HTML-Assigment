        <h2>The Hidden Messages in Water </h2>

        <p>I am not a type person to read a lot of books but I have read a few in the past couple of years. 
            <strong>The Hidden Messages in Water</strong> definetly caught my attention.<br>
            It talks about how thoughts, words— positive or negative, can affect us and everything around. Makes an interesting example
            with water and how nature can react to words and vibrations as well.

                <q>To give your positive or negative attention to something is a way of giving energy.<br>
                    The most damaging form of behavior is withholding your attention.

        <h2>About the Book</h2>

        <p>This book has the potential to profoundly transform your world view. Using high-speed photography, Dr. Masaru Emoto discovered that crystals formed in frozen water<br>
            reveal changes when specific, concentrated thoughts are directed toward them. He found that water from clear springs and water that has been exposed to loving words <br>
            shows brilliant, complex, and colorful snowflake patterns. 
            In contrast, polluted water, or water exposed to negative thoughts, forms incomplete, asymmetrical patterns with dull colors. <br>
            The implications of this research create a new awareness of how we can positively impact the earth and our personal health.
